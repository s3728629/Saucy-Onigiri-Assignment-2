            <h2>Project Progresses</h2>
            <h3>What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What hasn't worked well?</h3>
            <p>We have learned that creating a friendly and organised environment enables group projects to progress 
                more efficiently and actively. Our organisation and productivity has been the most prominent strength 
                within the group. Most of the time, our communication has been engaging and consistent. In terms of what 
                has not worked well, alerting the group on any events that may prevent members from joining meetings or 
                joining late could be improved.
            </p>
            <h3>What use did you make of your Mentor?  What use did you make of your Lecturer in guiding you?</h3>
            <p>Whenever we had a question to ask, we would always email Dr.B or schedule a meeting with him, as we knew 
                that he was there to help and assist us. When we have meetings with Trevor we always ask questions if we 
                have any.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project has inspired us to help those who are alone during our current worldwide pandemic and are
                unable to communicate with their friends and family. This also relates to the fact that the majority of
                us (Jessani, Dylan, Anisah, Yumi and Jade) have an interest in web development and feel that we will be
                able to successfully bring this prototype to life. We all know someone who needs this website and that
                is another reason why we feel that it will help people and why we are interested in this project.
            </p>
            <h3>What were the group processes for communication?</h3>
            <p>Our group used tools like Microsoft Teams for communication but the majority of our planning and 
                organisation is done verbally during our tri-weekly meetings. We made a clear schedule in the beginning 
                of the assignment so we could organise meeting times, due dates and expected contribution that works for 
                everyone. 
            </p>
            <h3>How effective were they? Have there been any changes since the start of the semester? </h3>
            <p>In relation to the chatbot, the resources that were provided to us immensely helped us in terms of creating 
                it and making it functional. At the start, we expected that the chatbot would require the most time to create. 
                Although, due to the feedback input and hyperlinks we received, the chatbot ended up being one of the quickest 
                tasks to make.
            </p>
            <h3>From your experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organising a project of this nature? </h3>
            <p>The most important aspect of this project is having members on the same page and the motivation towards the same 
                goal, which is extremely key for good and consistent progress of the project. Our team all had motivation for this 
                project leading to quality work on documentation, coding and were able to meet the deadline on time. 
            </p>
            <h3>Is there anything that you would do differently if you were to start again?</h3>
            <p>We would carry out more user interviews and user testing. This would continuously improve the design and coding of 
                our website. This will result in the website to be more appealing towards our targeted users and ensure that it is 
                more suitable towards their preferences. Furthermore, splitting the work between members could be handled more cautiously 
                and thoughtfully. As a result, the work amount for each member is more fair. 
            </p>
            <h3>What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project?</h3>
            <p>Organisation and motivation are the key aspects needed in order to advance in creating a similar project like ours. 
                Being orderly and consistent prevents the group from being unorganised and rushed to complete work. In addition to this, 
                motivation encourages all members to work more efficiently and productively. Working together during meetings and building 
                trust between one another enhances our motivation to progress in our project.
