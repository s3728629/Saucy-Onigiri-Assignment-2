                            <li>Question - What is a system content diagram? We are unsure of what it is.
                                <br>
                                Answer: There was a page. within week 6.. this should help us. If it does not clarify everything, we can email him. </li>
                            <li>Question - Do we have to make a functional prototype within the design page?
                               <br>
                                Answer: You do not need to make a functional prototype. we do not have to do a prototype at all.. since we already have our drafts.                                 </li>
                            <li>Question - Did we have to make a chatbot from scratch? We realise we do not have the skills to build one from scratch. Because, we have to pay for most of the samples. 
                               <br>
                                Answer: Make something that fits the purpose. if it does not fit the purpose, and does not fit with the rest of the project, then it is not fit to be made. Install lex and see if it fits for us. experiment with it. if you finish making the chatbot quicker than expected, then use the remaining time to make it better. Improve it and test it.
                                
                                Additionally, get your grandparents to test if the chatbot works. as well as do this for the rest of our features. </li>
                            <li>Question - Can you please review our Trello board if it is correct?
                               <br>
                                Answer: link particular actions to the MVF. Otherwise, I do not see a problem with it.                                 </li>
                        </ul>
