            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>Our website will be very useful and we feel it is a very important tool given the current environment in terms of communication. 
                The world is in crisis and now more than ever we need to rely on the trend of technology to communicate. 
                There are millions of people that have not been able to keep up with the rest of the world in regard to technological advances, even though they were surrounded by it with friends and family. 
                Now with social distancing and everyone being instructed to stay at home there will be many that cannot get their help from those they know and the only help is with the use of technical functions, hence they won't actually have any assistance at all. 
                We as a society have left people behind, and now for some, it is too late as they now are in full isolation and unable to have people to communicate with face to face. 
                If only we had encouraged and even pushed people to all be connected. This is why we feel motivated to have a website that can easily illustrate how to use their devices to communicate and keep them socially connected while in times like now. 
                This demonstrates our understanding of the current situation and that we want to make a difference to help people to connect with others virtually. We are motivated because we want the older generation to get familiar and be comfortable with using the technology that we use in our daily life.

            <h3>Aim and Goals</h3>
            <h4>AIM</h4>
            <p>2020 hasn’t exactly been the best year for anyone. With a toxic virus spreading uncontrollably around the state, forced lockdown has been implemented to avoid future transmissions between covid carriers and potential patients.
                Due to the decision to enforce citizens to remain in their homes, visits between families have temporarily been put on a hold. As a result, those who rely on face to face 
                communication are unable to accomplish their needs of socialising with those around them. Despite the barrier, the team at Stay Connected are determined to ensure that the elderly are able to socially connect with
                their family and friends during this rough phase. Our final product offers resources that will guide them to communicate without the need to meet in person. This will aid to suppress the number of cases and increase their mental health and wellbeing as the 
                elderly have found an alternative to connecting with those around them via the use of technology.
            </p>
            <h4>Goal One</h4>
            <p>Our final product would be a website containing various tutorials. From texting to calling, it offers assistance such as detailed lists of instructions regarding communication 
                between peers on an online platform. The tutorials are catered towards both android and apple users, making it accessible no matter the device one has. With the tutorials present, 
                the transition to communicating online should be smooth and completed with ease. Our first goal is for the elderly to be able to educate themselves rather than relying on others 
                whenever they feel the need to communicate. Through our tutorials, they are able to feel a sense of confidence as they have learnt a new skill and can now be independent when it 
                comes to technology. They wouldn’t need to pester others if they feel like face timing or messaging their family and friends due to the presence of the tutorials as it will guide 
                them to accomplish whatever they have in mind. 
            </p>
            <h4>Goal Two</h4>
            <p>Majority of the older generation have not had the privilege to incorporate the use of technology into their daily lives. This results in a lack of understanding and acceptance
                towards the use of mobile devices. Rather than having the idea of technology be frowned upon, our goal at Stay Connected is to be inclusive and ensure that the elderly are 
                comfortable and not afraid to include technology into their routine. We feel the need to encourage and promote online communication as it will come in handy during the current 
                pandemic, which has stopped families from seeing one another in real life. Our website would be easy to navigate around and the tutorials that we have listed are straightforward. 
                This reassures the older generation that it is not too late to rely on technology to communicate as it carries plenty of benefits given the current situation. 
            </p>
            <h4>Goal Three</h4>
            <p>After going through the various methods, our last goal is for the older generation to be able to apply their knowledge after learning a brand-new set of skills. 
                This will test their understanding and depict how useful the tutorials have been for them if they are able to accurately recall the steps without having the need 
                to rely on others. To ensure that they have retained brand new information regarding the various tutorials such as texting or calling, a post quiz will be available. 
                It will contain questions relevant to the material that they have just learnt and is aimed to check if the users have understood the content. Once completed, 
                it is a guarantee that the elderly are now confident enough to apply those skills in real life situations. Furthermore, it is alright to make mistakes. 
                The post quiz will reveal the correct answers if they happen to answer a question incorrectly. This will aid in the learning process too and the option to retake 
                the quiz is accessible if needed.

            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>The end result of our project, though incomplete, has the majority of our main features and extended features implemented. Our quizzes, tutorials, search bar and printable 
                guides are complete but unfortunately we were unable to integrate our chatbot. Some video tutorials had to be linked to an external source due to errors we could not fix 
                and they did not have voice over instructions like planned due to miscommunication within the team. The Pre-Quiz language preference and device preference were not 
                implemented due to lack of time.
