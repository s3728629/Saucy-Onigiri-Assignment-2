                Note that these challenges will likely vary for each person in the group. Only say the group found something challenging if all of you had an issue. 
                Use Tables to summarise</h3>
            
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>What have you found easy?</td>
                    <td>Design is less complex for us to learn and use in comparison to coding. Due to the majority of us studying User Centred Design and doing highschool 
                        portfolios in the past, we were able to easily create designs. Therefore, we had prior knowledge about design before commencing our project. In addition 
                        to this, we were able to use a free website software, Figma, which is relatively easy to learn and use in comparison to Adobe Illustrator which is paid. 
                        <br>User testing and feedback also had increased our productivity of developing and completing the designs quicker. Since we had asked our audience how to 
                        improve the design, we were able to identify the faults within our designs more efficiently. 
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>What have you found difficult?</th>
                    <td>Coding was the most challenging part of this project. Due to our lack of experience, we have provided extra time to research and learn how to code about 
                        our corresponding features we had been assigned to. The majority of us only have basic knowledge in making websites. For example, Jessani is required to code 
                        the feature, Pre-Quiz, which needs to use Javascript in order to change the css of the website as a whole in accordance to the users preferences from the quiz.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>What was unexpected?</th>
                    <td>At first, we thought one of our features, the chabot, would require the longest time to code. This is because we thought we had to code it from scratch. Although, 
                        our team members were able to find alternative solutions of finding chatbot templates or start up code. This would assist us in completing the chatbot quicker 
                        than expected. Additionally, we would more likely be able to complete our chatbot in time.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>In what ways have you been stretched?</th>
                    <td>During the time we were coding, we felt stressed about trello links for our project plan websites (Assignment two and three websites). There were a large amount 
                        of links that had to be implemented within the websites and we had encountered some issues of the quotation marks being slightly different. The quotation marks 
                        were different from the document when we were transferring the links into the code. Therefore, we had to fix those minor issues which lead the task to be more time 
                        consuming. Adding numerous links were unnecessary and repetitive when it could be simplified and referenced to one link that had everything.
                        <br>Otherwise, our project is generally very possible to do. Our 'Stay Connected' website does not contain any complicated systems or databases in the background.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <h3>What challenges were you expecting? What have you done to address these? Have they been overcome? </h3>
                <p>In terms of the challenges that we were expecting the most, it would have to be in relation to the creation of content with the development of our website and the main 
                features, since the designs we had created had some forms of ambitious expectations. However, the most expected challenge would definitely have to be the chatbot, as it 
                is the most ambitious feature and requires delving into a new area of IT development which is the AWS website and its sections.</p>
                <p>By assigning members to a task that covers all areas of project development at some point, it allows for each member to have a deeper understanding of what is going on 
                overall and some experience to help resolve problems should they arise, and by research and asking questions about areas of the project that we have little to no experience 
                in and require help.</p>
                <p>We have managed to find ways around our issues and overcome them at some point in the project's lifespan, through effort and due communication, asking for help from other 
                    members when it is needed as well as receiving feedback and asking questions to our mentors.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>What are the new skills or experience you have learned and/or developed? Include those that haven't worked out. For example, using a particular tool but finding that it won't 
                work in the way you anticipated. </h3>
                <p>Throughout our group assignments, everyone had a mutual agreement that a common skill that we all have developed is constantly improving out HTML and CSS skills.The final 
                    submissions always required to be presented in a HTML format, thus the need to regularly upload our content onto GitHub. Not only do we have to focus on the structure of 
                    the web page, but also the design aspect of it. This is when CSS comes in handy, the different styles support both accessibility and readability. Creating tabs on the navigation 
                    bar ensures the website is kept in an organised manner and avoids too much clutter stuck onto one page. The variety of colours, font size and font type also assists in 
                    legibility and helps cater towards ourintended users. Apart from HTML and CSS, JavaScript was a new addition to the list of skills learnt. We needed to incorporate a toggle 
                    hide show feature for our mini tutorials and to achieve this, JavaScript was needed to be incorporated.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Plans change, did yours? (plans can change in more ways than simply the timetable. For example, your aims and/or goals change, or roles change, or 	unanticipated events). 
                In hindsight, would you make any changes to your plan now? Have things turned out as you expected? What would you do differently if you had your time over again?</h3>
                <p>At the start of the project, we had created a set plan for the remaining weeks we had to work on it. In addition to this, our roles were already assigned to us at the start. 
                    Our deadlines and goals were set weekly for every meeting. We initially wanted to finish our MVF's and project website earlier, but due to many issues with a few of them, we 
                    were unable to meet our initial deadline. This is because of our lack of experience in coding, some minor issues we had encountered that prolonged our time to make the MVPs 
                    and permission issues related to our chatbot MVF.</p>
                <p>We did not expect to encounter this many challenges and difficulties during the project. And we did not expect the project to be completed a week later than what we had 
                    anticipated. If we were to do things differently, we would gain a larger scale of knowledge and learning in order to be prepared for next time.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Was your timetable realistic? What would you change in your timetable, knowing what you do now? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>Our timetable was realistic, we were all able to complete our tasks by the deadlines we set out. We all felt they were easily accomplishable as we set 2 deadlines in case anyone 
                was unable to complete by the first date they still had time by the second date which made sure no one finished a task really behind in the deadline and kept everyone on track. 
                We also made sure we had 3 meetings every week to get work done together or have discussions about our project and it's progress. This made sure everyone was on track with our 
                timetable and so our timetable was realistic as we all managed to complete our Stay Connected website by the deadline. An improvement though, could be to have the project finished 
                earlier to deduct more user testing and more time to improve on changes that needed to be made. Although, we were still able to complete user testing and changes. </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected? Have any of the risks you identified materialised? Have there been unanticipated events affecting your progress?</h3>
                <p>Overall most of the tools and softwares we've used have not posed any huge problems and we've had a generally smooth experience with them. This is because with most of the tools 
                    and softwares we used for this project, various team members were already familiar and had experience with using the tool. </p>
                <p>For GitHub, Dylan was already competent with using it and could easily set up the repository for our documentation and project. Dylan also set up our website on AWS as he was the 
                    most capable to do so. We were also able to successfully utilize Figma as a whole team, as a few team members had experience using it in a previous course and were able to help 
                    those who had never used it before. </p>
                <p>With unfamiliar softwares, our team probably had the most difficulties with Trello. At the start of the project our team did not have the correct layout for the Trello board and 
                    had to rearrange our board to it. We also had a few issues with Amazon Lex and connecting it to our website, but was unsolvable due to permission settings on AWS.</p>
