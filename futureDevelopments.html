            <h3>Project Manager</h3>
            <p>A project manager oversees the planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing a project. Which makes them responsible for the entire project scope and whether it fails or succeeds. Unlike the more technical jobs, a project manager’s soft skills is key to a successful project. These soft skills include leadership, motivation towards the project, communication between all project members, organisation, prioritization, problem-solving, and adaptability. </p>
 <p>These skills are essential to a project because project managers are in charge of relationships with the stakeholders of a project bridging their needs with the project team. Alongside that, the project manager is also responsible for leading the team in meetings and unifying the team when conflicts arise.</p>

 <h3>Website Developer</h3>
 <p>Web developers are responsible for coding and designing a website. They create functional and visually appealing websites according to the specifications given by the client. Likewise, they also modify websites. This job requires certain expertise in Javascript, JQuery, HTML and CSS/CSS3. These website programming skills will be incredibly important for our project. It leads our website to become functional for our users to interact with and use. In addition to this, the job also needs knowledge on UI (Web User Interface Design), Multimedia Content Development and API’s. Having some design and multimedia creation knowledge will enhance our projects ideas and development when creating our website. </p>
 <p>Another prominent aspect to the job is teamwork. Communication requires consistent communication with the client and it’s users in order to create websites that are satisfactory.</p>
 
 <h3>Multimedia Developer</h3>
 <p>Multimedia developers are integral members of any group who requires interaction and grasping the attention of their desired audience, as multimedia developers work in the field of manipulating what they see, how they see it and even how they see it, the work they do can simply be described as transmitting information into a form that is easily presentable and readable through multimedia mediums. Most commonly a multimedia developer can be seen designing, creating, or shopping digital forms of media with various sounds, animations, and text along with videos. What makes a multimedia developer most desired in an IT group project is the fact that alongside the creativity of editing and creating the final product, they have the technological knowhow to implement such things into a digital form through coding or other means. </p>
 <p>In terms of how they operate in a group environment, multimedia developers do need to be able to cooperate smoothly and communicate well with their team. Multimedia development is the manipulation of information, not the creation of it, so it is important that they clearly communicate to the team about what they plan to do, and what information they will need to do it, so that a full understanding of what is needed in the final product is gained. </p>

 <h3>UI/UX designer</h3>
 <p>User-interface designers focuses on the visual appearance of the final product. Whether it be an app or a website, their goalrelatesto the wayusers interact on an interface.Creating pages and ensuring smooth navigation between them is essential regarding this role. Not only does it have to be efficient, aUI designer needs to predict the thoughtprocesses of their intended users and design accordingly. By creating an interface with elements placed at where the users would immediately look for, they would have no issues moving around the web page. To also ensure that their designs syncwith the appropriate software, UI designers have to communicate and collaborate with other developers to guaranteetheirfunctionsturns out successful. Prototyping and testing plays the final partas it allows the UI designer to change any features if it doesn’t align with the needs of the intended users</p>
